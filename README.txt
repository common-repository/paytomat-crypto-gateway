Discover the crypto-world for your business. You can sell anything for the most popular cryptocurrency. To get started, you need a WooCommerce plugin.

== Description ==

Paytomat Crypto Gateway is a convenient free solution for those who want to find new customers and show that their business is moving with the times. This plug-in allows accepting payments in any popular cryptocurrency easily and quickly.

It does not matter what exactly you are selling – physical or digital goods. All of them can be sold for any digital currency supported by Paytomat. The list contains both popular projects and ones that are just at the beginning of their journey. Take the chance to make their users your customers!

This plug-in works in conjunction with two products – the popular WooCommerce plug-in and the Paytomat merchant’s web panel. The latter is responsible for all processes associated with crypto-wallets, transactions, and crypto-payment settings.

What exactly is Paytomat? It is an entire ready-to-use ecosystem built for cryptocurrency payments. It works through integration with Point of Sale systems, plug-ins for e-commerce, websites and online stores, and chat-boxes for instant messengers in social networks.

The payment process is quite simple:
Your customer selects the product and adds it to the shopping cart (as they would normally do anywhere else)
When they click the "Pay" button, customers choose the payment method and cryptocurrency they want to pay in. 
After that, a system generates a QR-code, which they have to scan with the crypto-wallet app
Crypto-assets are credited to your personal Paytomat account, from where you can manage them at your discretion.
